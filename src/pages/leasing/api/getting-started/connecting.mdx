# Connecting

While developing, you can connect to https://staging.api.beequip.nl/graphql. This prevents test data from polluting our 
production systems.

A token is required to make a connection. You can find the token on the settings page in your Beeport account, or contact us to
obtain a token. 
Add the token to each request with a header: 

```
Authorization: Token sYymN5aL5WvidYaLLTMJwaix
```

Furthermore, you can make calls to the API using whatever programming language or command line you require. 

When you’re ready to release your code, change the endpoint URL to https://api.beequip.nl/graphql. You’ll also need a 
new token for the production API. Please contact us if you need one.
