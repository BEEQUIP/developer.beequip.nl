# Limitations

To prevent abuse, each API user will get a certain points per hour to spend on queries and mutations.
With each request, the complexity of that request is calculated and subtracted from your points budget.

<Notification type="message">
    The data returned by the `rateLimit` query is mocked to simulate how it will
    be implemented. Use the query to find out what the implementation will look
    like.
</Notification>
