# About GraphQL

## Schema

GraphQL uses a typed schema. You can preview the schema using so-called schema introspection, which means you can 
query the schema for information about itself.  

Introspection is enabled on our API, and most GraphQL developer tools make introspection very easy, so you can discover 
the API possibilities using these tools. (We use GraphQL Playground.) 

## Example request 

GraphQL in its essence is JSON over HTTP using POST requests.  
For example, this request retrieves all names of our category groups and returns it as JSON: 

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token sYymN5aL5WvidYaLLTMJwaix" -X POST -d " \ { \  
    \"query\": \"query { categoryGroups { name } }\" \ } \" https://api.beequip.com/graphql
```
