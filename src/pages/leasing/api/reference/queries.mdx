# Queries

### categoryGroups

Use the query `categoryGroups` to retrieve our available categories. A category is required to request a lease.

### leaseBoundaries

Use the query `leaseBoundaries` to fetch the boundaries of a possible calculation for the given machine. You can 
perform it as the first query to check whether the object can be leased. You can use the returned values if the 
machine falls within the accepted boundaries. You’ll receive a set of min/max values for downpayment, balloon payment, 
purchase price, and tenor. You can use these for example in your form’s labels to show to the user.

### organizationSearch 

To perform a calculation, the Chamber of Commerce (“KVK”) number is required. You can ask your end user for that 
number, or use the query organizationSearch to build an autocomplete to find the Chamber Of Commerce 
using the company’s name. 

### leaseCalculation 

Use the query `leaseCalculation` to retrieve a lease price calculation for the given machine. This query will 
return a deal object and a lease object. You will need both to call `updateLease` and `requestDeal`. 

### leaseSuggestions 

Instead of calculating manually, use the query `leaseSuggestions` to retrieve 1 or more ready-to-go pricing 
plans for the given machine. For example, this query can give a suggestion for a calculation that results in the 
lowest possible monthly payment.
