# Guide to adding an object with the API

## Prerequistites

This guide assumes you are [authenticated](./authenticating) and have a valid token.

The simplified steps you need to take are:

1. Add a company with the mutation `addCompany`.
2. Fetch categories to find out the `id` of the category the object should be placed in, with the query `categoryGroups`.
3. Find out if the object is eligible for placement with the query `canObjectBePlaced`.
4. Add an object with the mutation `addObject`.
5. When the object is sold, call the mutation `deleteObject`.

## Adding a company

If you act as an intermediary for multiple companies that want to push equipment, you need to call the mutation `addCompany` for each company. If you only manage your own company, you should just call it once.

The mutation `addCompany` expects information about the company and its location. The mutation should look something like this:

```graphql
mutation AddCompany {
    addCompany(
        input: {
            chamberOfCommerceNumber: "63204258"
            name: "Beequip"
            street: "Willemskade"
            houseNumber: "18"
            postalCode: "3016 DL"
            city: "Rotterdam"
            telephoneNumber: "010 340 0844"
            website: "https://beequip.com"
        }
    ) {
        ... on AddCompanySuccess {
            company {
                id
                url
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When this example mutation is executed, it wil return the `id` and `url` of the newly created company.

<br />
<Notification type="message">
    Since GraphQL gives you control of what data you request, you can select
    more fields of the company to be returned.

We will be notified if you add a new company, and will review if we want them on our marketplace.

## Fetching categories

When adding an object, we need an `id` of the category the object belongs to. You can fetch a list of categories we use:

```graphql
query Categories {
    categoryGroups {
        id
        name
        categories {
            id
            name
        }
    }
}
```

The result is a list of categories, for example:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "categoryGroups": [
            {
                "id": "1",
                "name": "Agrarisch",
                "categories": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "name": "Agrarisch transport"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "id": "9",
                "name": "Kranen",
                "categories": [
                    {
                        "id": "19",
                        "name": "Mobiele telescoopkraan"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can use these `id`’s to make an internal mapping of your categories to our categories.

## Check if the object can be placed

We do not accept all equipment on our marketplace. One of these conditions is that we should be able to provide a lease for the object.

We’ve hidden our placement rules behind a query `canObjectBePlaced`. Call this before adding an object with `addObject`.

```graphql
query CanObjectBePlaced {
    canObjectBePlaced(
        input: {
            brand: "DAF"
            type: "XF 480"
            categoryId: 9
            purchasePrice: { publicPurchasePrice: 40000 }
            used: true
            yearOfConstruction: 2022
        }
    ) {
        ... on CanObjectBePlacedSuccess {
            verdict {
                ... on CanBePlaced {
                    canBePlaced
                }
                ... on CannotBePlaced {
                    canBePlaced
                    rejectionReasons
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The response would be something like this:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "canObjectBePlaced": {
            "verdict": {
                "canBePlaced": true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If `canBePlaced` is `true`, you’re free to call `addObject`.

## Adding an object

To publish a piece of equipment on our marketplace, call the mutation `addObject`. An example:

```graphql
mutation AddObject {
    addObject(
        input: {
            companyId: 1
            brand: "DAF"
            type: "XF 480"
            categoryId: 9
            purchasePrice: { publicPurchasePrice: 40000 }
            used: true
            yearOfConstruction: 2022
        }
    ) {
        ... on AddObjectSuccess {
            object {
                id
                url
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<br />
<Notification type="message">
    `addObject` accepts loads more properties than this example shows. The more
    properties you send, the better the conversion rate on our marketplace. Use
    your GraphQL tool to find the input type `AddObjectInput` and see what data
    you can send.
</Notification>

## Deleting an object

When an object is sold or no longer in the company’s inventory, you need to call `deleteObject`. This will soft-delete the object: the URL will still be accessible, but the object will no longer appear in searches and overviews on our marketplace.

```graphql
mutation DeleteObject {
    deleteObject(input: { id: 1 }) {
        ... on DeleteObjectSuccess {
            company {
                url
            }
        }
    }
}
```
