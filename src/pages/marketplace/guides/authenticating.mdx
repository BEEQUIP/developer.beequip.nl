# Authenticating

The marketplace API uses an [OAuth 2 client credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/) flow to authenticate requests. In short, you use your credentials to fetch an access token. Then, you sign further GraphQL query and mutation requests with this token.

1. Obtain credentials.
2. Get a token.
3. Make a GraphQL call.

## Obtain credentials

To authenticate with the API, you need a `client_id` and `client_secret`.  
When developing, you also need credentials to access our testing environment.

These will be provided by Beequip. Call us at [010 - 340 0844](tel:0103400844) if you're interested in using the marketplace API.

## Get a token

Make a request to https://staging.beequip.com/marktplaats/api/oauth2/token/ to fetch an access token. (Replace `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` with your own credentials, and `testing_password` with the password for the testing environment.)

```bash
curl -d '{"client_id":"<client_id>", "client_secret":"<client_secret>", "grant_type":"client_credentials"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Proxy-Authorization: Basic <testing_password>" \
    -X POST https://staging.beequip.com/marktplaats/api/oauth2/token/
```

This will yield an access token response.

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "access_token": "<token>",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
```

This token will be valid for one hour, after which you will need to fetch a new access token.

## Make a GraphQL call

Add the access token to the `Authorization` header and make a GraphQL request.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    -H "Proxy-Authorization: Basic <testing_password>" \
    -X POST -d "{\"query\": \"query { categoryGroups { name } }\" } \" \
    https://staging.beequip.com/marktplaats/api/graphql/
```

This will yield a list of categories of the marketplace.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "categoryGroups": [
            {
                "name": "Agrarisch"
            },
            {
                "name": "Energie"
            },
            {
                "name": "Wegtransport"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Going to production

To make your integration ready for a first release to production, you will need to change these things:

1.  The URL to get your token should change to https://beequip.com/marktplaats/api/oauth2/token/
2.  The URL for your GraphQL requests should change to https://beequip.com/marktplaats/api/graphql/
3.  You can omit the `Proxy-Authorization` header. (Nothing will break if you still send it, though.)
4.  You will need a new `client_id` and `client_secret` for the production environment.
