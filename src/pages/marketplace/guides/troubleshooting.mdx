# Troubleshooting

You might run into a problem you don't know how to solve. This guide lists common issues and their possible solutions.

### 401 Not Authorized

There's something wrong with your authorization header or your token. Read the returned error message for more details.

### No body returned for response

You're not sending the appropriate headers. [Add the headers](/marketplace/guides/authenticating#make-a-graphql-call) and try again.

### JWT expired at _some date_

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It's the mechanism the marketplace API uses for authentication. These tokens are only valid for one hour, and yours has expired. You need to [fetch a new token](/marketplace/guides/authenticating#get-a-token).

### Empty result

You're sending a query or mutation with return fields, but they don't show up in the result. This probably means an error has occured, but you're not querying the errors.

For example, if you're updating a company:

```graphql
mutation {
    updateCompany(
        input: {
            id: 1
            city: "Rotterdam"
            description: "Hand in hand, kameraden."
            houseNumber: "18"
            name: "Feyenoord Rotterdam"
            postalCode: "3007 AP"
            street: "Kuipweg"
            telephoneNumber: "0900 – 1908"
            website: "https://www.feyenoord.nl/"
        }
    ) {
        ... on UpdateCompanySuccess {
            company {
                id
                url
                city
                description
                houseNumber
                name
                postalCode
                street
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This should return several company fields when the mutation is done, but somehow this is your result:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "updateCompany": {}
    }
}
```

You should update the mutation to also query possible errors:

```graphql {27-30}
mutation {
    updateCompany(
        input: {
            id: 1
            city: "Rotterdam"
            description: "Hand in hand, kameraden."
            houseNumber: "18"
            name: "Feyenoord Rotterdam"
            postalCode: "3007 AP"
            street: "Kuipweg"
            telephoneNumber: "0900 – 1908"
            website: "https://www.feyenoord.nl/"
        }
    ) {
        ... on UpdateCompanySuccess {
            company {
                id
                url
                city
                description
                houseNumber
                name
                postalCode
                street
            }
        }
        ... on Error {
            __typename
            message
        }
    }
}
```

Run the mutation again and you might get a different result, like so:

```json {4-5}
{
    "data": {
        "updateCompany": {
            "__typename": "CompanyNotFoundError",
            "message": "The company with id 1 does not exist."
        }
    }
}
```

This means the mutation tries to update a company that does not exist. The `id` parameter should be changed to the `id` of an existing company. (You might get a different error in your specific case.)

Read the guide on [error handling](/marketplace/guides/error-handling) for more information.
